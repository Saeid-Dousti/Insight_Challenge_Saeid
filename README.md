# Insight_Challenge_Saeid

1) This project was conducted by Saeid Dousti on Pycharm editor on a windows machine.

2) The uploaded files are extensively tested and they worked with no issues and generated acceptable results

3) To execute the python files in src, run.sh is also used however, I face some wiered errors while I attempt to use run.sh to run the project

4) For testing my code a CSV files with 3000000+ complaints entries were downloaded and used. 

5) Due to the size limitation of the test input file which was about 1Gb, that test file could not be uploaded, but its report file is uploaded.
